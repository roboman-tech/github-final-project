Simple Interest Calculator

A simple interest calculator implemented in [language of choice, e.g., Python, JavaScript]. This project helps you calculate simple interest based on the principal, rate of interest, and time period.

Formula Used

The simple interest (I) is calculated using the following formula:

𝐼 = 𝑃 × 𝑅 × 𝑇

Where:

I = Simple Interest

P = Principal (the initial amount of money)

R = Rate of Interest (annual interest rate as a decimal, e.g., 5% = 0.05)

T = Time (time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years)

Variables Explained

Principal (P): The initial amount of money that is being invested or borrowed.

Example: If you deposit $1000 in a bank, the principal is $1000.

Rate (R): The annual interest rate, expressed as a decimal.

Example: A 5% interest rate would be represented as 0.05.

Time (T): The time period for which the money is invested or borrowed, typically measured in years.

Example: If you plan to invest for 2 years, T = 2.

Sample Calculation

Let’s say you have a principal of $1,000, an annual interest rate of 5%, and a time period of 3 years. The calculation will look like this:

I = 1000 × 0.05 × 3 = 150

So, the simple interest accrued over 3 years would be $150.

Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Run the program, input the Principal, Rate, and Time, and it will output the calculated Simple Interest (I).
